Dear reader,<br><br>

I’m thrilled to be sending you this very first letter. I thank you for wanting to be part of this.<br>
How often do I plan on sending you these letters?<br>
Once or twice a month. Or thrice. Or weekly. Yet another thing I'm not sure of. I hope that can inspire you to get started on that one thing you've been putting off for way too long because not having it all figured out has scared you. Trust me, none of us have it all figured out. Most of us are winging it majority of the time, hoping that our dedication (in combination with some luck) will bring us our desired outcome.<br>
Either way, I’m already looking forward to next time. Would you prefer these at the start of the week, or at the end of the week? Please let me know. Also, don't hesitate to share any thoughts that you might have. Some of the easiest ways to get in touch with me is on Instagram and Twitter.<br>
Alright, we have reached the end of our introductory letter. Thank you for reading, and welcome to the (unofficial) Serenity-family.<br><br>
I'll think of a less cheesy outro until next time.<br>
Prasun</p>
